This project is based on a udemy course.
The udemy course projects are all written in plain js.
I'm rewriting them using typescript 

This is the udemy coure:

  ##### Sending an email with a gmail account:
   
   ```js
   
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
    port: 465,
    secure: true,
    auth: {
        user: process.env.VERIFIED_SENDER,
        pass: process.env.SECRET_EMAIL_PASSWROD
    }
});

```

    - VERIFIED_SENDER : is the gmail email example matteo@gmail.com
    - SECRET_EMAIL_PASSWORD is the 16 digit password generated by gmail :
 go to gmail settings -> look for app password -> and add to others a password for nodemailer:

 - swagger-docs (bonus ‚≠ê - working üî®)
   - started experimenting on the openapi to create docs for my endpoint
   

- Authentication (working: uses mongodb)
    - started using mongodb as a database

creating public and private keys:

openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem


 In MongoDB, a schema defines the structure of a document, while a model provides an interface for interacting with the database.

A schema is a blueprint for the structure of a document. It defines the fields, their data types, and any validation rules for the document. A schema can be defined using the Mongoose library in Node.js. The schema provides a way to validate and enforce the structure of the data being inserted or retrieved from the database.

A model, on the other hand, is a higher-level abstraction that provides an interface for interacting with the database. It is a representation of a collection in MongoDB and is responsible for creating, updating, deleting, and querying documents in the database. A model is created using the schema and provides methods for performing operations on the database.

In summary, a schema defines the structure and validation rules of a document, while a model provides an interface for performing CRUD operations on a collection in MongoDB. The schema is used to create the model, and the model is used to interact with the database.
